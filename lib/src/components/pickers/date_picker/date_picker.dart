/// A Date picker is a graphical user interface element that used to select a date from a graphical calendar interface.
/// It allows users to easily choose a specific date by clicking or tapping on the desired day within the calendar.
/// Date pickers provide options for navigating between months and years. They are widely used in various applications,
/// including scheduling, event management, and form submissions, to facilitate the input of dates with accuracy and efficiency.
///
/// Use this widget to create date picker with platform-specific
/// styling and behavior:
/// - On IOS, [CupertinoDatePicker] is utilized.
/// - On Android, [DatePickerDialog] is used.

  /// date picker with the updated value.

  /// state changes directly.
  ///
  /// The [properties] parameter allows you to customize the visual and functional aspects
  /// of the tab view separately for Windows and macOS platforms.
  /// You can provide specific [properties] for each platform using `DatePickerAndroidProperty`
