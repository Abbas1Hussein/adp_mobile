/// Drawers are typically used with the [Scaffold.drawer] property. The child of
/// the drawer is usually a [ListView] whose first child is a [DrawerHeader]
/// that displays status information about the current user. The remaining
/// drawer children are often constructed with [AdaptiveListTile]s, often concluding
/// with an [AboutListTile].
///
/// The [AdaptiveAppBar] automatically displays an appropriate [AdaptiveIconButton] to show the
/// [AdaptiveDrawer] when a [AdaptiveDrawer] is available in the [AdaptiveScaffold]. The [AdaptiveScaffold]
/// automatically handles the edge-swipe gesture to show the drawer.
///
/// An open drawer may be closed with a swipe to close gesture, pressing the
/// escape key, by tapping the scrim, or by calling pop route function such as
/// [Navigator.pop]. For example a drawer item might close the drawer when tapped:
///
/// ```dart
/// AdaptiveListTile(
///   leading: const AdaptiveIcon(AdpIcons.archive),
///   title: const Text('Change history'),
///   onTap: () {
///     // change app state...
///     Navigator.pop(context); // close the drawer
///   },
/// );
/// ```
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Scaffold.drawer], where one specifies a [Drawer] so that it can be
///    shown.
///  * [Scaffold.of], to obtain the current [ScaffoldState], which manages the
///    display and animation of the drawer.
///  * [ScaffoldState.openDrawer], which displays its [Drawer], if any.
